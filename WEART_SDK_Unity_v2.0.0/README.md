# Unity SDK

## Introduction

Welcome to the WEART Unity SDK documentation.

The WEART SDK allows the creation of haptic experiences in Unity by enabling interfacing with the TouchDIVER devices for both PC and Android Standalone applications and TouchDIVER Pro for PC applications. The new SDK handles both platforms and allows development and testing from the Unity Editor, as well as the ability to build for Windows and standalone headsets:

* Start and Stop device execution
* Calibrate the finger tracking device
* Receive tracking data from the devices
* Retrieve raw data from the device
* Send haptic effects to the devices (actuations)
* Read status information from the device

The minimum setup to use the weart SDK consists of:

* A TouchDIVER device
* An Unity project using the SDK package 
* WeArt App running (only on the PC version)

### TouchDIVER Pro
